## Why Faux Cyrillic is not to be used

The faux name for the language is Я or ЯR however, it is officially known as er (or Р) because this letter makes an R sound in Cyrillic languages, and not Я. 

**Faux Cyrillic is considered unprofessional, especially when used in a project like this, where it would also be considered highly offensive.**

It is preferred to refer to the language as either Р or er. I tried to make the name a pun of R, but this just doesn't work entirely. This is as close as I can get.

Also note, **don't type the Latin letter P, but instead type the Cyrillic letter Р.** They look identical in most fonts, but there is a difference between these 2 characters, it just isn't very visible, until you get a bit more technical.

**See also:**

- [IDN Homograph attacks on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=IDN_homograph_attack&oldid=1155259652&useskin=monobook) for why you should be careful with Latin P and Cyrillic Р. This is also a very good piece of information in preventing yourself from being phished online.
